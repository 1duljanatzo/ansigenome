## What is a BSY degree?
 
A BSY degree is a four-year undergraduate program that focuses on the scientific aspects of psychology. Unlike a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Psychology, which emphasizes the liberal arts and humanities, a BSY degree requires more courses in mathematics, statistics, biology, neuroscience, and other natural sciences. This prepares students for conducting empirical research and applying psychological principles to real-world problems.
 
A BSY degree also offers more flexibility and specialization options than a BA degree. Students can choose from various concentrations or minors within psychology, such as clinical psychology, cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, social psychology, forensic psychology, industrial-organizational psychology, health psychology, or sports psychology. Alternatively, students can also combine their BSY degree with another major or minor outside of psychology, such as business, education, computer science, or sociology.
 
## What are the admission requirements and curriculum?
 
The admission requirements for a BSY degree vary depending on the institution and program. However, some common criteria include:
 
- A high school diploma or equivalent with a minimum GPA of 2.5 or higher
