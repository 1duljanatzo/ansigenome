# Milorad Pavic's Dictionary of the Khazars: A Novel in the Form of a Lexicon
 
Milorad Pavic was a Serbian writer, poet, and literary historian who wrote several novels that challenged the conventional form and genre of fiction. One of his most famous works is *Dictionary of the Khazars: A Lexicon Novel*, which was first published in 1984 and translated into 36 languages[^2^]. The novel is inspired by the history and legend of the Khazars, a nomadic people who lived between the Black and Caspian Seas and converted to one of three religions: Islam, Christianity, or Judaism. The novel consists of three books: the Red Book, the Green Book, and the Yellow Book, each representing a different religion and perspective on the Khazar question. The books are arranged as dictionaries or lexicons, containing entries on various topics related to the Khazars, such as characters, places, events, symbols, and myths. The entries are not arranged in alphabetical order, but rather in a way that invites the reader to explore different connections and interpretations. The novel also contains appendices, notes, cross-references, and illustrations that add to the complexity and richness of the text.
 
The novel is not meant to be read linearly or chronologically, but rather as a labyrinth or a puzzle that requires active participation from the reader. The reader can choose any entry to start with and follow the links and clues to other entries, creating their own path and meaning. The novel also challenges the notion of a single truth or reality, as each book offers a different version of the Khazar story, sometimes contradicting or complementing each other. The novel invites the reader to question the reliability and authority of historical sources, as well as their own assumptions and beliefs. The novel also plays with language, genre, and style, mixing fiction and fact, poetry and prose, history and fantasy, humor and seriousness.

One of the most intriguing aspects of the novel is the role of dreams and dream interpretation. The novel begins with a dream that the Khazar khan has, in which he sees a fish with three heads and three tails. He asks three philosophers, one from each religion, to explain the meaning of his dream and to persuade him to adopt their faith. Each philosopher gives a different interpretation, based on their own beliefs and scriptures. The dream sets the tone for the rest of the novel, as it introduces the themes of multiplicity, ambiguity, and choice that pervade the text.
 
The novel also contains many other dreams and visions that reveal important information or secrets about the characters and the Khazars. For example, one of the entries tells the story of Avram Brankovich, a Jewish merchant who dreams of a hidden book that contains the true history of the Khazars. He embarks on a quest to find the book, which leads him to encounter various dangers and mysteries. Another entry tells the story of Princess Ateh, a Khazar woman who has prophetic visions that foretell the fate of her people. She becomes a powerful figure in the Khazar court, influencing the decisions of the khan and his advisers.

The novel suggests that dreams and visions are not only products of the subconscious mind, but also windows to other realities and dimensions. The novel implies that there are multiple layers of existence, and that some people have the ability to access them through their dreams. The novel also explores the relationship between dreams and language, as some characters use special alphabets or codes to communicate their dreams or to decipher them. The novel shows that dreams and language are both creative and interpretive processes that shape our understanding of ourselves and the world.
