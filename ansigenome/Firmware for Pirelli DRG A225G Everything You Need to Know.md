1. Download the latest firmware file from the official website of Pirelli or your internet service provider. Make sure you download the correct file for your router model and region.
2. Extract the firmware file to a folder on your computer. You may need a program like WinZip or 7-Zip to do this.
3. Connect your computer to the router using an Ethernet cable. Do not use a wireless connection, as it may be unstable and cause problems during the update.
4. Open a web browser and type in the router's IP address in the address bar. The default IP address for Pirelli DRG A225G router is 192.168.1.1. If you have changed it, use the new one.
5. Enter your username and password to log in to the router's web interface. The default username and password for Pirelli DRG A225G router are admin and admin. If you have changed them, use the new ones.
6. Go to System > Firmware Upgrade. Click the Browse button and locate the firmware file that you extracted earlier. Select it and then click the Upload button.
7. Wait while the update is applied. Do not turn off or disconnect the router or your computer during this process, as it may damage your router or cause it to malfunction.
8. When the update is complete, the router will reboot automatically. You may need to reconnect to the router and log in again.
9. Check if the firmware update was successful by going to System > Status. You should see the new firmware version displayed on the screen.
10. If everything is working fine, you can delete the firmware file from your computer and enjoy your updated router.

If you encounter any problems during or after the update, you can try resetting your router to factory defaults by pressing and holding the reset button on the back of the router for 10 seconds. This will erase all your settings and restore the original firmware, so you will need to reconfigure your router afterwards.
 
Alternatively, you can contact Pirelli customer support or your internet service provider for further assistance.
