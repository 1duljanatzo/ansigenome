# How to Play LotR: War of the Ring Without a CD
 
If you are a fan of the Lord of the Rings franchise, you might have played the real-time strategy game LotR: War of the Ring, released in 2003. The game lets you control the forces of good or evil in the epic battles of Middle-earth. However, if you have lost or damaged your original CD, or if you want to play the game on a modern computer without a CD drive, you might be looking for a way to play it without a CD.
 
Fortunately, there is a solution: a No-CD Fixed EXE file. This is a modified version of the game's executable file that bypasses the CD check and allows you to run the game without inserting the CD. You can download this file from various websites that offer game patches and cracks, such as GameCopyWorld or MegaGames. However, be careful when downloading files from unknown sources, as they might contain viruses or malware.

To use the No-CD Fixed EXE file, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Make sure you have installed the game on your computer and updated it to the latest version (1.01).
2. Download the No-CD Fixed EXE file for your version of the game (English, French, German, etc.) from a reliable website.
3. Extract the file from the archive and copy it to your game folder, replacing the original WarOfTheRing.exe file.
4. Run the game as usual and enjoy!

Note that using a No-CD Fixed EXE file might violate the terms of service of the game and its publisher, so use it at your own risk. Also, some antivirus programs might detect the file as a threat and block it, so you might need to disable your antivirus or add an exception for the file.
 
With this method, you can play LotR: War of the Ring without a CD and relive the adventures of Frodo, Aragorn, Gandalf and others in Middle-earth. Have fun!
